# Work Body

## A small collection of some of my code

##### Note: I also have some screenshots of a personal project I have been working on that I would like to share with you both.  Beside the obvious objective of functionality, my other main goal is to work on creating simple, easy to understand, and beautiful looking user interfaces.  I have the code for this project as well if there is interest, but because I am actively working on it right now, the code is still messy and needs to be cleaned up.
